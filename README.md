### 🎬 MoviesCatalog (MovieDB) 🎥

Welcome to the **MoviesCatalog**! 🌟 where your favorite films come to life through the wonders of the Movie Database (TMDB) API. Whether you're here for a laugh, to learn, or just to procrastinate from your actual work, we've got you covered. 😜

## 📜 Project Overview

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to combine your love for coding with your love for movies? No? Well, too bad, because that's exactly what we've done here 😜

## 🚀 Features

- **Epic Posters**: Behold the majesty of movie posters that practically jump off the screen and slap you with nostalgia!
- **Trailers**: Because why just read about a movie when you can watch the trailer and pretend you're actually going to watch the whole thing later?
- **Search Functionality**: Lost in the sea of movies? Just type a word or two, and we'll pull up the movie you're thinking of—or at least a bunch of movies you weren't thinking of.
- **User-Friendly Errors**: Because even when things go wrong, they should still be funny!

## 🤓 How to Use

1. **Clone the Repo**: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yehyeh/Movies-Catalog.git
   ```
2. **Open the Project**: Open it in Xcode.

3. **Run the App**: Hit that play button like you're starting a new life as a coder. Watch as the app compiles (or throws errors—who can predict these things?).

4. **Enjoy**: Browse movies, watch trailers, and show off to your friends !

## 🧙‍♂️ Magic Behind the Scenes

This app is powered by sprinkles of Swift, a dash of SwiftUI, and a bit of API calls. We're talking:
- **URLSession**: For those sweet, sweet data-fetching vibes.
- **Async/Await**: Because who has time to wait around? Not us.
- **Image Caching**: So we don't burn your mobile data package faster than you can say "4K streaming".

## 🙌 Contributing

If you've got some funny ideas, or just feel like adding to the madness, feel free to fork this repository and send us a pull request! Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility. Or at least, more bugs to fix.

## 🐛 Bug Reporting

Found a bug? That's impossible! But if you did, file an issue, and we'll hunt it down like a terminator on a mission. 🤖

## 🎉 Acknowledgments
